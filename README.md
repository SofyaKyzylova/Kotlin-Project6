Kotlin homework 6 for my Advanced Engineering School classes. OOP


Implement a program "Zoo", in which there should be three types of creatures: Animals, birds, fish.
All creatures must have methods for the actions of “breathing and “moving".


These methods should output information to the console about how the creature breathes and how it moves, respectively. 
Each of the types should have its own implementation.


For each of the types, create several types of animals, add some unique actions to them (e.g. the lion roars).


The user should get a numbered list of all the animals. By entering the number of the animal from the keyboard, information is displayed for it:
The name of the animal, how it breathes, how it moves
